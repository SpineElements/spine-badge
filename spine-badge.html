`spine-badge` represents a small badge-like piece of UI with a customizable content and style.
It is displayed as an inline block alongside its adjacent content.

Example:
```
<spine-badge>5</spine-badge>
<spine-badge>A longer text </spine-badge>
```

### Styling

You can use the regular CSS attributes like color, background, margin, font, border, and
others to customize its appearance.

Besides, it can be customized with the following custom properties:

Custom property           | Description                                  | Default
--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------
`--spine-badge-size`      | the height and a minimum width for the badge | 21px
`--dark-theme-text-color` | the default background for the badge         | none
`--primary-color`         | the default text color for the badge         | `inherit`


### Differences From the `<paper-badge>` Element

`<spine-badge>` has a purpose similar to the `<paper-badge>` element, but provides
some of the capabilities not supported by `<paper-badge>`:
- Specifying arbitrary content with child nodes.
- Automatic horizontal resizing according to its content. As such, it has only the
  `--spine-badge-size` custom property for customizing its height (with minimum width)
  instead of `--paper-badge-height` and `--paper-badge-width`, and is not displayed as an ellipse
  when its width is greater than its height.

Besides, if you're migrating from `<paper-badge>`, be aware of the following issues
with the `<spine-badge>` element:
- It doesn't support a <paper-badge>'s capability of being displayed on the top-right
  corner of another element.
- It doesn't have a `label` and `icon` properties, but the same effect can be achieved by placing
  an appropriate content as its child nodes.
- It uses the regular CSS `background`, `opacity`, `color` CSS properties instead of
  `--paper-badge-background`, `--paper-badge-opacity`, and `--paper-badge-text-color` custom
  properties for styling the respective aspects of its appearance.
- It has a different appearance by default, but it can be tuned with CSS to match
  the `<paper-badge>` element (see the "Styling" section above).

TODO:2017-04-20:dmitry.pikhulya: we might need to make this element compatible with paper-badge
                                 (and work as its extended version)
